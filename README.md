# Password_Generator

This password generator refers to the Scrumba solo project design. By applying form tag in #HTML and Math. random and array methods in #JavaScript, I achieved this password generation web app with flexibility for users to customise the length and the character types for their passwords.

Prefer dark mode? No problem! This web app also apply dark mode style toggle function in #JavaScript with the checkbox tag in #HTML.
